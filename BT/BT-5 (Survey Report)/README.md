# Survey Report on Types of Blockchain and Its Real-Time Uses

## 1. Introduction
Blockchain technology is a decentralized and distributed ledger system that enables secure, transparent, and tamper-proof transactions. It eliminates the need for intermediaries by maintaining a shared record of transactions across multiple nodes in a network. The blockchain concept gained popularity with the introduction of Bitcoin in 2009, and since then, various types of blockchains have evolved to suit different applications.

## 2. Types of Blockchain

### 2.1 Public Blockchain
**Definition:**  
A public blockchain is an open network where anyone can join, read, write, or participate in the consensus process. It is fully decentralized and transparent.

**Key Features:**
- Open access for all users  
- High transparency  
- Uses Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS) for consensus  
- Slower transaction speed due to large participation  

**Examples:** Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin  

**Real-Time Use Cases:**
- **Cryptocurrency:** Bitcoin and Ethereum used for peer-to-peer payments.  
- **Smart Contracts:** Ethereum enables decentralized applications (DApps).  
- **Supply Chain Tracking:** Public networks like VeChain improve product traceability.

### 2.2 Private Blockchain
**Definition:**  
A private blockchain is a restricted network controlled by a single organization. Only authorized participants can access or validate transactions.

**Key Features:**
- Controlled access  
- High privacy and faster transactions  
- Centralized governance  
- More suitable for enterprise use  

**Examples:** Hyperledger Fabric, R3 Corda, Quorum  

**Real-Time Use Cases:**
- **Banking:** R3 Corda used by financial institutions for secure data sharing.  
- **Healthcare:** Private blockchains store patient records securely.  
- **Supply Chain:** IBM Food Trust for tracking food origin and quality.

### 2.3 Consortium (Federated) Blockchain
**Definition:**  
A consortium blockchain is semi-decentralized, managed by a group of organizations rather than a single entity. It combines features of both public and private blockchains.

**Key Features:**
- Permissioned access controlled by multiple organizations  
- Shared decision-making  
- Better scalability and security than public chains  

**Examples:** Energy Web Foundation, IBM-Maersk TradeLens  

**Real-Time Use Cases:**
- **Banking:** Consortiums like RippleNet facilitate cross-border payments.  
- **Logistics:** TradeLens enhances transparency in global shipping networks.  
- **Energy Sector:** Energy Web Chain for decentralized energy trading.

### 2.4 Hybrid Blockchain
**Definition:**  
A hybrid blockchain integrates both public and private blockchain features, allowing selective data access.

**Key Features:**
- Partial transparency  
- Controlled data access  
- High flexibility  
- Suitable for organizations that need both openness and privacy  

**Examples:** Dragonchain, XinFin (XDC Network)  

**Real-Time Use Cases:**
- **Government Systems:** Public verification with private record management.  
- **Retail:** Sharing limited data with partners while keeping sensitive info private.  
- **IoT Networks:** Secure device communication with controlled data sharing.

## 3. Comparative Analysis

| Type of Blockchain | Access Control | Transparency | Speed | Governance | Examples |
|--------------------|----------------|---------------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Public             | Open to all     | High          | Low    | Decentralized | Bitcoin, Ethereum |
| Private            | Restricted      | Low            | High   | Centralized   | Hyperledger, Corda |
| Consortium          | Group-controlled | Moderate      | Moderate | Semi-decentralized | RippleNet, TradeLens |
| Hybrid             | Mixed           | Partial        | High   | Flexible     | XinFin, Dragonchain |

## 4. Real-Time Industry Applications

1. **Finance:**  
   - Cross-border transactions using Ripple and Stellar.  
   - Asset tokenization and DeFi using Ethereum.

2. **Supply Chain:**  
   - Transparency using IBM Food Trust and TradeLens.  

3. **Healthcare:**  
   - Secure patient record storage via private blockchains.  

4. **Government:**  
   - Land registry and voting systems using hybrid models.  

5. **Energy Sector:**  
   - Decentralized power trading using Energy Web Chain.

## 5. Conclusion
Blockchain technology has evolved beyond cryptocurrencies to support diverse industrial applications. Public blockchains focus on transparency, private ones ensure privacy, consortium blockchains promote collaboration, and hybrid blockchains balance both. The choice of blockchain type depends on the use case, scalability needs, and data sensitivity.
